>Work & Personal projects

Rapal (2018-)
Working in a tight-knit Agile team to deliver a smoother engagement with your work environment.

Developing with a wide array of technologies, including .NET Core, Angular & React Native. A small collection of developers and self-organizing teams means that you get a peek in every corner of the product, from the code to the actual production servers. 

Academic Work (2018-2019)
After a 3 month crash course on building applications using .NET, I jumped to Rapal as an IT consultant for a year.
